# Changelog — what changed and why
## Format
Each entry follows: `date (IST) — change — metric movement — why — owner — link`. “Metric movement” cites concrete deltas (e.g., `alignment +11pp`, `latency +6.6%`, `tone drift −32%`, `bytes_out −62%`). “Link” is a repo-relative path to the artifact or summary.
