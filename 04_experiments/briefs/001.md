# Experiment Brief — exp_001_quoted_spans
## TL;DR (one breath)
Quoted key spans in answers to cut citation drift, holding latency and safety.

## Why now
Reviewers flagged paraphrase drift; trust suffers. A small, surgical change can fix it quickly.

## Hypothesis
Quoted spans will raise citation_alignment by ≥8pp with ≤10% latency increase; refusal stable (≤+1pp).

## What changes (variant description)
During answer synthesis, bind sensitive facts to short quoted spans from the source. Show the quote (≤12 words), then paraphrase plainly. Keep citations minimal (one authoritative source). No retriever or prompt changes—only span insertion and formatting.

## What we’ll measure
- citation_alignment (0..1): share of statements exactly supported by source text.  
- latency_ms: end-to-end response time in milliseconds.  
- helpfulness (0..1): rubric on directness, next step, tone.  
- refusal_rate (0..1): share of prompts resulting in refusals.

## Smallest 48h test
n=20 per variant; EN/HI/UR/ES (5 each); deterministic seed=42; identical prompts.

## Success criteria (gates)
Alignment +8pp or more; latency ≤ +10%; refusal ≤ +1pp.

## Assumed sample data (looks like this run)
| variant | citation_alignment | helpfulness | refusal_rate | latency_ms |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Baseline | 0.61 | 0.72 | 0.08 | 820 |
| Quoted_spans | 0.72 | 0.73 | 0.09 | 874 |
Observation: +11pp alignment; +6.6% latency; +1pp refusal—passes all gates.

## Risks & mitigations
- Over-quoting hurts readability → cap quote length; paraphrase immediately.  
- Reviewer bias in alignment scoring → blind, randomized evaluation.  
- Domain skew or language imbalance → enforce 5 per language; stratify analysis.

## Runbook (6 steps)
1) Prepare prompt set and toggle variant flags.  
2) Run both variants on identical inputs.  
3) Capture outputs, spans, timings, refusal flags.  
4) Bootstrap CI (5k resamples) for alignment delta.  
5) Write one row to 04_experiments/results.csv; update 07_data_behavior/data.csv.  
6) Tag commit exp_001_quoted_spans and push.

## Decision gate
KEEP if all gates pass; otherwise KILL or ITERATE on span rules.
