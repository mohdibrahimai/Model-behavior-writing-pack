# Experiment Brief — exp_002_system_style
## TL;DR (one breath)
Apply a concise system style to cut tone drift with neutral cost.

## Why now
Voice varies by task and language; inconsistency erodes trust. A shared style reduces drift.

## Hypothesis
A concise system style guide reduces tone_drift_rate by ≥30% with Δhelpfulness ≥ −1pp and Δlatency ≤ +2%.

## What changes (variant description)
Introduce a ~120-word house style as a system prompt: TL;DR first, minimal citations, gentle refusals with adjacent help, multilingual cadence (EN/HI/UR/ES), and short, actionable sentences. Add five lint rules (TL;DR present, quoted span if claiming facts, refusal+adjacent-help, brevity, multilingual politeness cue). Log violations per response.

## What we’ll measure
- tone_drift_rate: share of responses violating five style rules (lower is better).  
- helpfulness (0..1): clarity, actionability, correctness.  
- latency_ms: end-to-end response time in milliseconds.  
- refusal_rate (0..1): share of prompts resulting in refusals.

## Smallest 48h test
n=24 per variant; EN/HI/UR/ES (6 each); Latin-square across tasks; seed=17.

## Success criteria (gates)
tone_drift_rate drop ≥30%; Δhelpfulness ≥ −1pp; Δlatency ≤ +2%; Δrefusal ≤ +1pp.

## Assumed sample data (looks like this run)
| variant | tone_drift_rate | helpfulness | refusal_rate | latency_ms |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Baseline | 0.22 | 0.73 | 0.07 | 780 |
| System_style | 0.15 | 0.72 | 0.07 | 792 |
Observation: −32% drift; helpfulness −1pp; latency +1.5%; refusal flat—meets gates.

## Risks & mitigations
- Stilted tone → keep guide concise; include tiny examples; review weekly.  
- False lint flags → human spot-check 10%; adjust rules.  
- Language bias → per-language slices; tune phrasing.

## Runbook (6 steps)
1) Prepare the 120-word style prompt.  
2) Apply to variant; keep baseline unchanged.  
3) Auto-lint five rules and log violations.  
4) Compute drift, helpfulness, latency, refusal.  
5) Record a row in 04_experiments/results.csv; note in ablations.md and decision_log.md.  
6) Tag commit exp_002_system_style and push.

## Decision gate
KEEP if all gates pass; else ITERATE once on style scope and re-test.
