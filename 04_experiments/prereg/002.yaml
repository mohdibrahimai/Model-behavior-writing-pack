hypothesis: "A concise system style guide will reduce tone_drift_rate by ≥30% with Δhelpfulness ≥ −1pp and Δlatency ≤ +2%."
background: |
  Taste should be explicit: undocumented norms cause inconsistent voice and user confusion.
  A compact, enforceable style guide can reduce tone drift without harming helpfulness.
  Risks include over-politeness or stiffness, especially across languages; we tune cadence per locale.
  We expect neutral latency impact given minimal prompt overhead.
variants: [baseline, system_style]
sample_size_per_variant: 24
metrics:
  tone_drift_rate: "Share of responses violating five style rules (lower is better)."
  helpfulness: "0..1; rubric on clarity, actionability, and correctness."
  latency_ms: "End-to-end response time in milliseconds."
  refusal_rate: "0..1; proportion of prompts that result in refusals."
data_sources: ["02_golden_transcripts.md", "data/helmsman.jsonl"]
population: "Mixed tasks: confirmations, ambiguity nudges, refusals, low-bandwidth; EN/HI/UR/ES evenly represented."
randomization: "Latin-square across tasks × language; seed 17."
procedure: |
  1) Apply a ~120-word system style guide (house voice, refusals, citations, cadence).
  2) Run 48 prompts (24/variant) balanced across tasks and languages.
  3) Auto-lint five rules; log violations with tags and language.
  4) Compute tone_drift_rate, helpfulness, latency_ms, refusal_rate per variant.
  5) Write a row to 04_experiments/results.csv and update ablations.md and decision_log.md.
stop_rule: "Stop at n=24/variant; abort if refusal_rate worsens by >2pp."
accept_thresholds:
  tone_drift_rate_relative_drop_pct: 30
  helpfulness_delta_pp_min: -1
  latency_delta_pct_max: 2
  refusal_delta_pp_max: 1
analysis_plan: |
  Compare tone_drift_rate via two-proportion z-test; report relative change with 95% CI.
  Slice by language to detect bias; Holm-correct follow-ups.
  Summarize helpfulness and latency deltas; flag regressions exceeding thresholds.
  Persist a single summary row to results.csv and notes to decision_log.md.
risks:
  - "Stilted tone — keep guide concise; include examples; audit weekly."
  - "False positives in lint — review sample of flags; tune rules."
  - "Language bias — per-language slices; adjust phrasing for HI/UR/ES."
ethics_policy: |
  No deceptive claims; clear refusals with adjacent help.
  Respectful multilingual phrasing; avoid stereotypes or insensitive wording.
  Minimize citations to key spans; avoid link dumping.
outputs:
  - "04_experiments/results.csv (append summary row)"
  - "07_data_behavior/ablations.md (entry stub)"
  - "08_ops/decision_log.md (note with outcome)"
notes: |
  Assumed baselines: tone_drift_rate=0.22, helpfulness=0.73, latency_ms=780, refusal_rate=0.07.
  Expected outcome: drift ≈0.15 (−32%), helpfulness within −1pp, latency within +2%.
